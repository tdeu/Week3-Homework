I deployed the TokenizedBallot contract at block 1000, with the contract address being 0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3. Then, I deployed the Token contract at the same address. Minted 10 tokens to account 0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8 and verified that the balance was updated correctly. After minting, I self-delegated all voting power for account 0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8, ensuring full voting authority.

Following that, I transferred 5 tokens from account 0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8 to account 0x3c44cdddb6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12fa4293bc. I checked the past votes for account 0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8 and observed the voting power at different blocks. All interactions were successful, and transaction hashes were recorded for each successful transaction.

For potential failures during function executions, appropriate revert reasons were provided.
